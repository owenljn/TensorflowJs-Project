# TensorflowJs-Project
This project is developed with tensorflowJs and Tiny YOLO model, it utilizes user's webcam and is able to detect pobjects in real time based on what the webcam sees

Please refer to this repository for more details:

Right now, tensorflow.js is not mature enough to handle some full size pre-trained models, but it does open a whole new world of Machine Learning, image anyone with their cellphone is alble to train and recognize objects in real-time.
